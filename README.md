# Android Meetup Cwb - June 2018
This is a simple example of the two most popular architectures on Android MVP and MVVM. It's was part of a presentation made on Android Meetup CWB in Curitiba. 

The project was build to use as less libraries as we could since the goal was to understand the benefits of using both architectures and their conceptual differences. 

The repository (data layer) is really simple and was created to show that it's totally independent of the selected architecture.

The application has just two Activities and if you want to run the code of one of them just uncomment the code in AndroidManifest.xml.
